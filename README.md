# C-king-
Work code that allowed me  to create my own bot using click() method and x and y coordinates 

If you want to use find an x, y coordinate you want to be clicked on your computer and then use the click(x, y) method
Example x coord = 500, y corrd = 500 
click(500, 500);

If you want to right click you can use the click2 method 
Example: 
click2(500, 500); 

There is also a timer method that can delay time between clicks if needed for a page to refresh or a page to load
robot.delay(miliseconds);
Example:
robot.delay(4000):
Makes robot delay 4 seconds
